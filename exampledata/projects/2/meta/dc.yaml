  **Lighting the Darkness: Dutch Mining Lamps**
  is a 3D Scholarly Model of 15 mining lamps from the collection of the ex-miner
  Hans Dubbel.
  The project was developed by the Nederland Mining Museum in Heerlen, Limburg
  with the help of the PURE3D Project based out of Maastricht University. 

  These 15 lamps are a selection of Hans Dubbel's collection
  of more than 30 mining lamps ranging in date of manufacture from 1800-1970
  and originating from countries across Continental Europe and the British Isles.
  The lamps tell both big narratives about the role of industrial coal mining
  in the Netherlands, how innovation in mining technology altered
  mining safety and practice as well as personal stories about the miners,
  their families and the coal mining communities.
  The goal of the digitisation effort is to make this collection of lamps available
  to online audiences so that they may appreciate
  and connect with the history of Dutch coal mining. 
instructionalMethod: |-
  The mining lamp collection can be explored as a whole
  in a single Voyager instance whereby all lamps that were digitized
  can be viewed and explored via annotations, articles and guided tours.

  The *first tour* talks about mining lamp technology, manufacture and development
  within the context of early modern Europe.

  The *second* tour highlights the collector, Hans Dubbel,
  his life and his experiences as a miner from 1950-1970. 

  Within the articles of each lamp there is a hyperlink to
  individual Voyager instances of the single lamp.
  The Voyager instances for each lamp contain information about the lamp's design
  and ownership (if known) as well as first-hand accounts from ex-miners
  about their experiences in the mines and their relationships with light
  and these lamps.
