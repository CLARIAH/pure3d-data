<h1>Difficulty in Tuning Hurdy-gurdy</h1><p>The tuning mechanism using pegs is the same as that of violins or guitars. However, tuning Hurdy-Gurdy is more difficult than tuning violins or guitars, because the tuning of this instrument does not end with the adjustment of the open strings; the position of the each keys and the cotton threads at the contact points between the Wheel and the strings affect the pitch of the sound, so the entire instrument, including these, must be adjusted to obtain correct tuning.</p><p>According to 13th-century treatise,&nbsp;Quomodo organistrum construatur&nbsp;(‘How an organistrum should be constructed’), early form of Hurdy-gurdy is tuned based on Pythagorean principles. However, because the tangents can be adjusted to tune individual notes, it is possible to tune hurdy-gurdies to almost any temperament as needed.&nbsp; Today, most performers use the equal temperament, which is easier to harmonize with other instruments.</p>
