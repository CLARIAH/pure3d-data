<h1>Early form of Hurdy-gurdy</h1>
<p><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(173, 173, 173);">During the Gothic period a large hurdy-gurdy (</span><em style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(173, 173, 173);">organistrum</em><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(173, 173, 173);">) was used in many cloisters and monastic schools to teach music, perform religious polyphony and provide correct intonation for singers. Generally considered the ancestor of all subsequent hurdy-gurdies, the organistrum differs substantially from later instruments in that it was played by two individuals: one turned the crank while the other pulled the keys upward to change the musical pitch of the melody strings.
