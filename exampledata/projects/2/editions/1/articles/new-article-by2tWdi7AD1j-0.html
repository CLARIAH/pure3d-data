<h1>Frosch Lamp</h1><p>The Frosch Lamp was barely used in the Dutch mines because of safety issues. The oil in the lamp was supplied directly to the wick, creating an open flame. When this flame ignited flammable gases in the mine, it would cause an explosion. This could happen at any moment, which is why using the lamp in the mine was seen as a Russian Roulette. This is why after the invention of the Davy Lamp, which didnâ€™t have an open flame, the Frosch Lamp was barely used anymore.</p><p>
