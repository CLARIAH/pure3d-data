    Clanwilliam House, 1-2 Clanwilliam Place, was part of a row of Georgian houses
    on the city side of Mount Street Bridge on the intersection
    with Lower Mount Street and facing the Grand Canal.

    Samuel Wilson, a retired merchant sailor, his family and servants lived in
    1 Clanwilliam Place, while the family and servants of carpenter and contractor
    Andrew Mathers occupied 2 Clanwilliam Place, next door.
    (NAI, 1911 census returns; DCLA, Dublin City Electoral Rolls, 1915;
    Thom’s Directory, 1916).

    A large, three-storey building, it offered an unobstructed view of the bridge
    and down Northumberland Road.

    On *Easter Monday*, the building was occupied by George Reynolds
    (section commander),
    Daniel Byrne, William Ronan and James Doyle, the door having been opened for them
    by a maid (MAI, BMH WS 309).

    On *Tuesday morning*, Paddy Doyle, Richard Murphy
    and brothers Thomas and James Walsh
    were sent from Boland’s Bakery, headquarters of the 3rd Battalion
    under its commandant, Eamon de Valera, to reinforce the garrison in
    Clanwilliam House.
    Daniel Byrne was assigned to carry dispatches leaving seven men in possession
    of Clanwilliam House on *Wednesday morning*.

    By that time, furniture had been used to fortify windows but the glass
    had not been smashed and no other measures taken to prepare for an assault
    on the building.
    Each Volunteer was positioned at one of ten second and third storey windows
    at the front of the house facing the canal.
    On hearing fire from 25 Northumberland Road, the garrison opened fire
    on the advancing Sherwood Foresters.

    Clanwilliam House was the last of the rebel posts to fall following
    a concerted rush by troops from the 2/8th and 2/7th Sherwood Foresters
    during which the house caught fire.
    George Reynolds, Paddy Doyle and Richard Murphy were killed during the fighting
    (MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198).

    The building remained unoccupied after the Rising until it collapsed
    during a storm in 1920
    (Thom’s Directory, 1917; Irish Independent, 18 Jan. 1920).
