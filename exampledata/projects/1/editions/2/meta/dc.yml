    Clanwilliam House, 1-2 Clanwilliam Place, was part of a row of Georgian 
    houses on the city side of Mount Street Bridge on the intersection with 
    Lower Mount Street and facing the Grand Canal. Samuel Wilson, a retired 
    merchant sailor, his family and servants lived in 1 Clanwilliam Place, 
    while the family and servants of carpenter and contractor Andrew Mathers 
    occupied 2 Clanwilliam Place, next door. (NAI, 1911 census returns; 
    DCLA, Dublin City Electoral Rolls, 1915; Thom’s Directory, 1916). 
    A large, three-storey building, it offered an unobstructed view of the bridge 
    and down Northumberland Road. On Easter Monday, the building was occupied by 
    George Reynolds (section commander), Daniel Byrne, William Ronan and James Doyle, 
    the door having been opened for them by a maid (MAI, BMH WS 309). On Tuesday morning, 
    Paddy Doyle, Richard Murphy and brothers Thomas and James Walsh were sent from 
    Boland’s Bakery, headquarters of the 3rd Battalion under its commandant, 
    Eamon de Valera, to reinforce the garrison in Clanwilliam House. 
    Daniel Byrne was assigned to carry dispatches leaving seven men 
    in possession of Clanwilliam House on Wednesday morning. By that time, furniture
    had been used to fortify windows but the glass had not been smashed and 
    no other measures taken to prepare for an assault on the building. Each Volunteer 
    was positioned at one of ten second and third storey windows at the front of the 
    house facing the canal. On hearing fire from 25 Northumberland Road, the garrison 
    opened fire on the advancing Sherwood Foresters. Clanwilliam House was the last of the 
    rebel posts to fall following a concerted rush by troops from the 2/8th and 2/7th Sherwood 
    Foresters during which the house caught fire. George Reynolds, Paddy Doyle and Richard Murphy 
    were killed during the fighting (MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198). 
    The building remained unoccupied after the Rising until it collapsed during a storm in 1920 
    (Thom’s Directory, 1917; Irish Independent, 18 Jan. 1920).
