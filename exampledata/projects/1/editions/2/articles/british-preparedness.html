<h1>Preparedness of the British Troops</h1><p>Seven companies of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, popularly known as the Sherwood Foresters, followed the tram route on the Coast Road into Dublin city centre (four of the forward column, the 2/7th, and three from the rear column, the 2/8th). There were approximately 1,750 soldiers between the two battalions.&nbsp;The soldiers were being trained to fight in the open fields of the Western Front, and had between approximately three to eight months of training, depending on when they joined the Regiment. They were not trained for the city fighting or fighting in a built-up environment (as no British solder was at the time) that they would encounter in Dublin. The battalions had never been in an operational environment and urban warfare was not included in the training for units earmarked for service on the Western Front.</p><p><br></p><p>The Sherwood Foresters were armed with the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield (SMLE), Mark III rifle which fired a .303 inch calibre round; each man was issued with 120 rounds of ammunition, which should have been enough for an engagement such as the Battle of Mount Street Bridge. The Battalions’ Lewis Guns (automatic machine guns) were left in Liverpool. The reason for this is unclear. The Regimental History of the 2/7th indicates that it might have been because there was not enough space on the boat for them. But the Regimental History of the 2/8th indicates that the reason the guns were left behind was that ‘men were wanted and not guns’.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>(Oates, The Sherwood Foresters, p. 35-38; Hughes, Campbell, Schreibman; The Robin Hoods, p. 279, 282)</p>
