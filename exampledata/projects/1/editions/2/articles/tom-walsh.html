<h1>Thomas Walsh</h1><p><img src="media/Thomas_Walsh.jpeg" width="200" style="float: right;" hspace="15px"></p><p>Thomas Walsh (1899-1970), member, B Company, 3rd Battalion, Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers. Born in Dublin in 1894, and the eldest of six children who survived to adulthood, Walsh trained as a carpet layer. His father was a coal factor and his parents ran a greengrocer’s from the family home in East James’s Street in the city. Walsh joined a company of the Irish Volunteers in Sandymount shortly after their formation in November 1913; his brother James soon joined the same company. It was after the split with the supporters of John Redmond in 1914 that Thomas and James Walsh joined B Company, 3rd Battalion. Between 1914 and 1916, the Walshs and their father assisted in the transportation of arms for the Irish Volunteers. (MAI, BMH WS 198; NAI, 1911 census returns). Thomas and James Walsh spent the majority of their service in the Irish Volunteers and Irish Republican Army (IRA) together.</p><p>On Easter Monday 1916, Thomas Walsh and his brother joined the rebels in Boland’s Bakery under Éamon de Valera. The following day, they were dispatched to Westland Row train station and on returning were informed that they would be among four men being sent to reinforce the garrison in Clanwilliam House. Both took part in the defence of Clanwilliam House and remained inside until its fall on Wednesday evening. Thomas was briefly knocked unconscious by his Mauser rifle after firing it for the first time on Wednesday afternoon. Having escaped from the burning Clanwilliam House, he encountered opposition from locals in Mount Street, whom he threatened with his revolver, and was forced to seek shelter. Unable to return to Boland’s, Walsh spent the rest of the Rising in hiding in halls and houses around the Baggot Street area. He and his brother remained on the run in the homes of family and friends, including a period together in the Beaumont Convalescent Home, until December 1916 (MAI, BMH WS 198; MAI, MSPR 34/REF/8975).</p><p>Thomas Walsh remained active in the republican movement after 1916. He served as a company transport officer during the War of Independence and the family home was used as an arms dump. He was on active service as a cyclist during ‘Bloody Sunday’ 1920 and later claimed that he had offered his services to the anti-Treaty IRA during the Civil War but had never been called to take part in armed action (MAI, MSPR MSPR 34/REF/8975). Walsh was married with two sons and two daughters.</p><p>Thomas Walsh died on 2 December 1970 (Irish Times, 4 Dec. 1970).</p>
