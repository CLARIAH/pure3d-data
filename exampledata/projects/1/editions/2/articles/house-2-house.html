<h1>House to House Searching</h1><p>Once 25 Northumberland Road had been occupied, British&nbsp;troops began house to house searches along Northumberland Road, as they were uncertain as to which buildings the Irish troops occupied. As they made their towards Clanwilliam House, there was painfully little cover for the British soldiers. ’Those that managed to get under cover of the bridge, both from Northumberland Road and Percy Place, now attempted to cross the Bridge, led by an officer. They charged in small groups of about 8-12, but they did not succeed. They went down on the Bridge again, and again they made the attempt, but did not survive. By now there was a great pile of dead and dying on the Bridge’.&nbsp;</p><p>(BMH WS0198, p18)</p>
