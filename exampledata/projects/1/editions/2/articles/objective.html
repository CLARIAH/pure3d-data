<h1>The Objective: Clearing the Area of Irish Troops</h1><p>Once the battle began, the objective of marching to the grounds of Trinity College Dublin changed to clearing the area of Irish troops in the region of Mount Street Bridge.&nbsp;</p><p>Once fighting had begun with shots from Malone and Grace in 25 Northumberland Road, British troops began to make their way up Northumberland Road. Some were shot as they came parallel with Parochial Hall, but those who were able, made their way up the street, often in small groups of 8-10, with little by way of cover.&nbsp;Other troops tried to reach Mount Street Bridge via flanking routes, to the left via Percy Lane or to the right via a laneway behind the School House.&nbsp;</p><p>(BMH WS0198, p18)</p>
