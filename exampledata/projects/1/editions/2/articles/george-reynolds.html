Born in Dublin and educated at the Christian Brothers’ School on Synge Street, Reynolds trained as an ecclesiastical and general silversmith and owned a shop in Abbey Street in the city centre. He lived in Redmond’s Hill with his siblings; two of his sisters ran a shop from the premises. Reynolds joined the Gaelic League, becoming a fluent Irish speaker, before becoming a member of the Irish Volunteers around 1915. He was described as being of ‘unobtrusive disposition, and fond of athletic and outdoor pastimes, cycling, walking, fishing’ (NAI, 1901 census returns; NAI, 1911 census; MAI, MSPR WDP6236; Catholic Bulletin, 1916). On Easter Monday, Reynolds was given command of the garrison of Volunteers in Clanwilliam House, which by Wednesday numbered seven. The last rebel post to fall during the Battle of Mount Street Bridge, the house sustained continued assault before eventually catching fire. Reynolds was hit by rifle fire and killed, one of three members of the garrison to die during the fighting. Aged thirty-eight during Easter week, Reynolds was among the eldest and most senior Volunteers to take part in the battle. His body was incinerated in the flames that engulfed Clanwilliam House (MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198).</p><p><br></p>
