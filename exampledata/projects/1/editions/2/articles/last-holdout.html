<h1>The Last Holdout</h1><p>Clanwilliam House was the last of the rebel posts to fall following a concerted rush by troops from the 2/8th and 2/7th Sherwood Foresters during which the house caught fire. Both Irish and British sources agreed as to the timing of the fall of the house, somewhere between around 9.30-10.30 at night. Three of the seven men occupying Clanwilliam House died in the battle: George Reynolds, Paddy Doyle and Richard Murphy. The others escaped through the back basement window. The Walsh brothers along with William Ronan escaped to continue fighting. James&nbsp;Doyle went in another direction, was wounded, but carried to safety. He managed to escape down the country after the Rising where he remained until Christmas 1916.&nbsp;</p><p>The badly damaged building remained unoccupied after the Rising until it collapsed during a storm in 1920.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;(Thomâ€™s Directory, 1917; MAI, BMH WS 127; MAI, BMH WS 309; MAI, BMH WS 198; Irish Independent, 18 Jan. 1920)</p>
