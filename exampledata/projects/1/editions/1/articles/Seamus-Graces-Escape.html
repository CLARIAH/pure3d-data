<h1>Seamus Grace's Escape through the Back Garden</h1><p>Grace escaped from the building through the basement into the back garden. By climbing over the garden wall, he reached the nearby Percy Lane. He spent several days hiding in multiple locations around the neighborhood while firing on the British at night. Grace explained why he adopted this approach in his Bureau of Military History Statement: ‘I had several firing exchanges&nbsp;[...].&nbsp;As I was in uniform I had to lie low by day and fire by night on patrols.’</p><p><table class="image" width="500" align="center">

</table></p><p>On Saturday morning, British soldiers discovered Grace in a shed and captured him. He was kept alive due to the intervention of a British officer who wanted him questioned. Grace’s valued possessions including his watch and rosary beads were taken from him as he was marched away with other prisoners. Over the course of three Court Martials, Grace was interrogated where he confessed to being a sniper at 25 Northumberland Road. When he was asked what he had done after the battle, Grace admitted in his own words ‘very foolishly’ to having fired on patrols.</p><p>(MAI, BMH WS 310)</p>
