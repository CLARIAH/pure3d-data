</table></p><p>Irish Volunteers took up strategic positions around Dublin on Easter Monday in anticipation of the British response, they positioned men on the main roads leading to the city centre so as to block or at least impede the British advance.</p><p>One such defense was taken up by C Company (led by Lieutenant Michael Malone) who positioned his men in four buildings along Northumberland Road just south of Mount Street Bridge: 25 Northumberland Road, Parochial Hall, the Schoolhouse&nbsp;(abandoned on Tuesday as the position was too far back for clear sightlines), and Clanwilliam House. C Company was attached to Éamon de Valera’s 3rd Battalion of the Irish Volunteers.</p><p>Although a British response was expected by the Irish resistance, there was no guarantee as to where it would come from. As soon as C Company had taken their positions, they were almost completely cut off from the outside world, save from occasional resupplies from relatives, or news called out from the street.</p><p>(MAI, BMH WS 310, 1949)</p><audio controls><source src="media/LUCA_Positioning_of_C_Company.wav" type="audio/wav">Your browser does not support the audio element.</audio>
