<h1>Seamus Grace</h1><p><img src="media/Seamus_Grace.jpeg" width="181" style="float:right" hspace= "15px"></p><p>Fighting alongside Malone at 25 Northumberland Road was Seamus Grace (1888-1959) who was also&nbsp;a volunteer serving in C Company. A native of Dublin, Grace worked as a General Clerk at the College of Surgeons (NAI, 1911 census returns). He joined the Irish Republican Brotherhood in 1912, where he attended meetings and was issued a .22 caliber pistol. In August of 1913, Grace left Ireland for America. Before leaving, he was given the credentials for Clan na Gael- a republican organization in the States. To his regret, he lost these credentials and consequently, after eighteen months, moved to Canada where he joined the Canadian army. It was there that he learned how to shoot a rifle.&nbsp;</p><p>After three months in the army, British agents began to make inquiries into his activities. A letter written&nbsp;by a colleague in the IRB in Gaelic was sent to Grace within which was written: “we’re waiting for you”. Taking this as an opportunity for escape, Grace packed his back and departed for Dublin immediately.</p><p>(MAI, BMH WS 310, 1949,pp. 1-3)</p>
