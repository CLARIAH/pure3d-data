Born in Dublin, Malone was a carpenter who had won prizes in art and drawing from the Technical Schools. A devout Catholic, he was a member of St Patrick’s Confraternity in Ringsend, Dublin (Catholic Bulletin, 1916). Described as ‘the crack shot of his Company’.&nbsp;</p><p>He was described by Seamus Grace, who occupied 25 Northumberland Road with him during the battle, to have been “a fine well-built young man with good features, serious minded but with an excellent sense of humour, but when the occasion arose could be a very strict disciplinarian”. He was one of the few Volunteers who had a handgun during the Battle.</p><p>(MAI, BMH WS 310, 1949, p. 1)</p>
