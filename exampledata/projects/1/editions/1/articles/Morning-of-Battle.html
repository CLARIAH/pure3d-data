</table></p><p>Approximately 1,750 Sherwood Foresters from the 2/7th and the 2/8th battalions disembarked in Kingstown on the morning of the 26th. By 11am, they began the almost seven mile march&nbsp; towards Trinity College in Dublin’s City Centre. The 2/7th down the coast road, with the 2/7th acting as the leading battalion. This advance position meant they would be the first to encounter serious resistance.&nbsp;</p><p>Not everyone in Ireland was hostile to the British soldiers arrival. On their march through the Dublin suburbs, soldiers were “pressed with refreshments” by pro-Unionists. They also received maps, information, and even a pair of field glasses, or binoculars. By noon, they had received warning that Northumberland Road along their route would be particularly dangerous.</p><p><br></p><p>(Maconchy, 1920; “The Robin Hoods”, 1921)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
