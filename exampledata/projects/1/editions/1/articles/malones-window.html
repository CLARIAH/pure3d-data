</table><p>Despite being occupied by only two men, 25 Northumberland Road put up an effective defense against the advancing British soldiers. As the Sherwood Foresters approached, Malone took up position in a third floor bathroom window. Armed with a modified Mauser automatic pistol (nicknamed a ‘Peter the Painter’), Malone found opportunity to live up to his crack shot reputation and was responsible for several of the casualties inflicted upon the British.&nbsp;</p><p>His vantage point gave him many targets from behind effective cover including the easily identifiable officers and especially those who tried to flank the side of the building. These unsuccessful charges stalled the Sherwood Foresters advance, buying Malone, Grace, and any other Irish Volunteers in firing range more time to inflict casualties.&nbsp;</p><p>(Papadopoulos &amp; Schreibman, 2022)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>
