    details the events and actors of a key battle
    which occurred during the 1916 Easter Rising in Dublin, Ireland.

    The Battle of Mount Street Bridge 3D Scholarly Model
    is a 3D photorealistic construction of the area around Mount Street Bridge
    that transports users back to a leafy suburb in Dublin, Ireland, in April 1916
    to better understand the spatial and temporal dimensions
    of one of the most important battles in the Easter Rising.
    During this battle, the first of the week-long event, against all odds,
    a small group of Irish Volunteers held off two battalions of
    British soldiers for the better part of the day.
    The goal of the project is to better understand the battle,
    bringing new insights to this century-old event. 

    The project contains four Voyager Instances
    that help to tell both big narratives about the socio-political
    context of the 1916 Rising,
    the events before, during and after the Battle of Mount Street Bridge,
    as well as the human toll of the Battle of Mount Street Bridge
    on individuals from both sides of the conflict.
    The 3D models of the neighborhood and individual buildings
    offer an interactive method of telling these stories.
    Archival images, records and oral accounts enrich the 3D model of the buildings
    so that the stories are authenticated by primary sources.

  Contested Memories – Battle of Mount Street Bridge
  is a Digital Humanities project directed by
  Susan Schreibman and Costas Papadopoulos at Maastricht University.
  The project is developed as part of a pilot project for the PURE3D Infrastructure,
  funded by the Platform Digitale Infrastructuur - Social Sciences and Humanities
  (PDI- SSH).
  The project began in 2016 as part of the centennial commemoration
  of the Easter Rising and was developed out of Maynooth University.
  A 3D reconstruction of the Mount Street area of Dublin in 1916
  was commissioned by the project and executed
  as an offline Unity application by 3D artist John Buckley. 

  The Mount Street Project was re-invigorated in 2021
  as a pilot project for the PURE3D Infrastructure.
  The 3D assets for the project are presented using the Smithsonian Voyager Explorer
  online software in which text, images and other relevant multi-media
  about the battle is presented via annotation labels, articles and tours. 

  In Spring 2022, an Honours Course at Maastricht University collaboratively authored
  a first draft of the Voyager Instance for 25 Northumberland Road.
  In June 2022, this instance was user-tested via a focus group
  and a Qualtrics Feedback Survey.

  The Battle of Mount Street Bridge 3D Scholarly Model
  contains four individual Voyager instances for exploring and learning
  about the events and actors of Mount Street.
  The project is designed in a way that offers optional additional layers
  of linked open data for further exploration of the base narrative. 

  The first voyager instance is offers a broad overview of the wider battle
  in terms of volunteer positioning and prep as well as British movements
  to the area of conflict. This instance is meant to offer
  a superficial introduction and big-picture view of the event
  that offers opportunities to explore more about each specific buildings
  and the individuals associated with them.
  These more detailed stories are offered to the user within relevant articles
  that provide a link to the subsequent instances on three key buildings from the battle. 

  The other three instances focus on individual buildings
  that were occupied by the Irish Volunteers.
  They are:

  *   25 Northumberland Road,
  *   Parochial Hall and
  *   Clanwilliam House.

  Each instance contains annotation labels, articles and tours
  that provide contextualizing information and personal stories
  about the Irish and British combatants
  as they specifically relate to the building and it's role during the battle. 

  25 Northumberland Road tells of the Irish Volunteers,
  Michael Malone and Seamus Grace, positioned in that building.
  This building was the first to engage the British. 

  Parochial Hall was the next building
  with Irish Volunteer occupiers to engage in conflict with the British troops. 

  Clanwilliam was the last building to fall to the British.
  There were seven volunteers stationed inside.
