  Pure3D: Scholarly projects centered around 3D data.

description: |-
  PURE3D is a three-year project funded by the
  [PDI-SSH (Platform Digitale Infrastructuurâ€“Social Sciences and Humanities)](https://pdi-ssh.nl/nl/home/)
  with a mission to advance the virtual research environment through the
  development of an access
  infrastructure for viewing interactive Digital Heritage and Digital
  Humanities 3D content online. The platform intends to target the unique needs
  and abilities of both the content creators (researchers, educators, cultural
  heritage managers) as well as the end-users (students, public, academics,
  etc.).

  Building on the conventions of text-based digital scholarly editions, PURE3D
  will provide tools to integrate multiple types of source materials (e.g.,
  annotations, images, video, structured/unstructured data) and document the
  creation process (paradata), providing users with direct access to the
  modelling and interpretative choices creating a multimodal resource
  impossible to replicate in print form.

  PURE3D is aware of the issues that research-based 3D content creators may
  encounter in making their projects and data accessible on the web. File size,
  format, technical know-how and funding are some of the issues. The PURE3D
  platform will act as a preservation repository for projects, developing a
  conceptual and methodological framework for valorizing and evaluating 3D
  scholarship, so that the outputs of 3D digital scholarship can meaningfully
  contribute to the whole of the academic ecosystem.

  The PURE3D Project is based out of the
  [Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences at Maastricht University](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/about-um/faculties/faculty-arts-and-social-sciences)
  under the direction of
  [Dr. Costas Papadopoulos](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/k.papadopoulos)
  and
  Prof. Susan Schreibman.
  A number of partner institutions join PURE3D as pilot
  projects or in advisory roles and technical support. 

  **This platform is in a alpha-phase of production and is currently only
  displaying a selection of 3D editions developed by project partners in the
  last year. As such, it is not yet possible to build and publish your own 3D
  project at this time. Please follow us on social media as development on the
  platform continues. For more information about the Project with news and
  event updates, please visit the
