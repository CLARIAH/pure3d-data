    Pure3D: Scholarly projects centered around 3D data.
  description: |-
    Building on the conventions of text-based digital scholarly projects,
    PURE3D provides tools to integrate multiple types of source materials
    (e.g., annotations, images, video, structured/unstructured data)
    and document the creation process (paradata),
    providing users with direct access to the modelling and
    interpretative choices creating a multimodal resource
    that is impossible to replicate in print form.

    The platform intends to target the unique needs and abilities
    of both the content creators
    (researchers, educators, cultural heritage managers)
    as well as the end-users (students, public, academics, etc.).

    PURE3D is aware of the issues that research-based 3D content creators may encounter
    in making their projects and data accessible on the web.
    File size, format, technical know-how and funding are some of the issues.
    The PURE3D platform acts as a preservation repository for projects,
    developing a conceptual and methodological framework
    for valorizing and evaluating 3D scholarship,
    so that the outputs of 3D digital scholarship
    can meaningfully contribute to the whole of the academic ecosystem.

    **PURE3D** was a three-year project funded by the
    PDI-SSH (Platform Digitale Infrastructuurâ€“Social Sciences and Humanities)
    with a mission to advance the virtual research environment
    through the development of an access infrastructure
    for viewing interactive Digital Heritage and Digital Humanities 3D content online.

    The Project was based out of the Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences
    at Maastricht University under the direction of
    Dr. Costas Papadopoulos and Prof. Susan Schreibman.

    A number of partner institutions joined PURE3D as pilot projects
    or in advisory roles and technical support.

    Information about the partner institutions and pilot projects
    can be viewed in the Partners section of this website.
