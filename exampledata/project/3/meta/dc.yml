  Diaconie Weeshuis

abstract: |-
  In the latter half of the 17th century, the Diaconie Weeshuis, an orphanage
  managed by a protestant church, proudly overlooked the Amstel river. It was
  located on former ‘Vlooienburg’, an island constructed in the Amstel for
  urban expansion around 1600. The orphanage was constructed in 1656, and stood
  for 230 years before it got replaced by a new building in Neogothic style in
  1888. In the 1980s the entire neighbourhood was demolished to make space for
  the new Amsterdam city hall and opera (nick named ‘stopera’).

description: |-
  The Diaconie Weeshuis does not exist anymore. It was demolished and replaced
  by a new building in 1888. The model was therefore based on historical maps,
  depictions and 19th century photography. 

  The sources give some indications of the construction materials used for the
  walls, windows, and roofs. No colour photography was invented before the
  demolition of this building, so the best indication is gained from this 1785
  drawing van H.P. Schouten. The building most likely had reddish bricks,
  sandstone blocks in the recessed arches on ground floor, and all woodwork
  painted off-white or yellow (although this may have changed over its
  lifetime). The gates and pediments on the roof were most likely of a kind of
  stone, either with natural surface or painted to match the woodwork. The
  shutters appear to have been painted in a greyish tone. From the other
  depictions we know that the roof was covered with small diamond shaped slate
  tiles.
