<h1>The east side<br></h1><p>In the 1656 document, only the front and back sides of the building are depicted. For the other two sides, we rely on other sources. The eastern side has been amply documented over the ages. From this information we can infer its symmetrical layout, and the shape and number of windows, doors and dormers. </p><p>The position and dimensions of these architectural elements had to be estimated, but as the design is strongly symmetrical and matching features are present on the front and back side, the reconstruction is fairly certain.<br></p><p>A peculiar feature of both sides are the round windows in vertical recesses in the wall. These are most likely the location of the building's staircases. Comparing the old and more recent documentation, we may observe that the upper six of the circular windows of the left staircase have at some point been replaced by regular windows. Perhaps this is indicative of an interior repurposing.<br data-mce-bogus="1"></p><p><br data-mce-bogus="1"></p><p><br data-mce-bogus="1"></p>
