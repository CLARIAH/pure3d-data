<h1>Its main dimensions<br></h1><p>No accurate metrical information of this building is preserved, such as construction drawings, detailed architectural plans or cross-sections. The approximate dimensions of this building have been based on the 1832 cadastral mapping, which included the outlines of the building.<br data-mce-bogus="1"></p><p>Its height is based on two drawings of the front and backside that accompanied the original document that celebrated the operning of this building in 1656. <a data-mce-href="https://archief.amsterdam/beeldbank/detail/e8356751-0f6c-de35-0927-ce2a25207af8" href="https://archief.amsterdam/beeldbank/detail/e8356751-0f6c-de35-0927-ce2a25207af8">A copy of this document dated to 1733 is available at the Amsterdam City Archives</a>.<br data-mce-bogus="1"></p><p>Since these drawings appear to be reasonably accurate orthographic ("without perspective") views of the building, they were used as basis for the model. To verify this, the reconstructed height was compared to the relative height to the neighbouring houses that appear on 19th century photography. For these houses, we have better metrical information available. This showed that the 17th century drawings had more or less the correct proportions, and could indeed be used as architectural scale drawings.<br data-mce-bogus="1"></p>
