<h1>The courtyards<br></h1><p>The least amount of information is available for the walls facing the two courtyards. The only evidence we have is the shape of its ground plan. The wall and roof construction is completely speculative. The assumption that there were structures with a seperate roof on the short sides, is based on the fact that the foot print of the north and southern sections is wider than that of the east and western sections of the building. The window placement is based on the window placement on the exterior of the building.<br data-mce-bogus="1"></p>
