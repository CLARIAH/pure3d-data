<h1>The materials<br></h1><p>The sources give some indications of the construction materials used for the walls, windows, and roofs. No colour photography was invented before the demolition of this building, so the best indication is gained from this 1785 drawing van H.P. Schouten. The building most likely had reddish bricks, sandstone blocks in the recessed arches on ground floor, and all woodwork painted off-white or yellow (although this may have changed over its lifetime). The gates and pediments on the roof were most likely of a kind of stone, either with natural surface or painted to match the woodwork. The shutters appear to have been painted in a greyish tone. From the other depictions we know that the roof was covered with small diamond shaped slate tiles.<br data-mce-bogus="1"></p>
