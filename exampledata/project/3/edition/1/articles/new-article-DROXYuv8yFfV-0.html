<h1>The west side<br></h1><p>The west side is not depicted as often as the east side. In addition, on all depictions, a complete view of this side is limited by the houses next to the orphanage. For the part that is visible, we can observe that the window arrangement mirrored the east side. Therefore, for this reconstruction we have assumed a symmetry for the entire west side. </p><p>On depictions of the east side, we can see that there was direct access to the water, and this was used to service the building with supplies. The west side on the other hand, was accessed by a narrow ally. It is therefore possible that the doors (if any) were placed differently here than on the east side.<br data-mce-bogus="1"></p>
