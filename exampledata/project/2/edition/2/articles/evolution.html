<h1>The Evolution and Diffusion of Hurdy-gurdy</h1>
<p>
  One of the major involvement between the early form of Hurdy-gurdy, the
  organistrum, and the Hurdy-gurdy today is the way the keys are placed. The
  organistrum player had to change the pitch by "pulling" the keys rather than
  "pressing" them. The piano as we know would make a sound when the keys are
  pressed down. Imagine the opposite: a piano that produces sound by pulling up
  on the keyboard. This is a very strange way of playing, picking up each key
  and pulling it up, but this was the way the organistrum played. As you can
  imagine, Pulling keys upward is cumbersome and it is not practical to play
  fast passages in this way, so only slow tunes like religious music&nbsp;could
  be played on the organistrum.&nbsp;

  In order to solve the inconvenience caused by this structure, the Hurdy-gurdy
  has evolved to change pitch by pressing down on the keyboard. Besides, the
  overall size of the instrument was reduced, allowing it to produce higher
  notes and to be played solo. This made it an ideal instrument for folk music.
  Eventually it left the cloister altogether and became firmly established as a
  minstrel instrument. Its spread was facilitated by the wandering players who
  found employment in increasing numbers as court and town life flourished and
  the church began to accept their participation in religious processions and
  similar events. In this way the hurdy-gurdy insinuated itself into every level
  of Western society from palace to village green. It was used as a melodic
  instrument in dance music, especially during festivities and church holidays;
  it was found in the ‘orchestra’ at mystery plays; it was played by pilgrims
  and above all by itinerant minstrels, peasants, beggars and blind
  musicians.<img src="media/16931247900_4b7a1af896_k.jpg" />
