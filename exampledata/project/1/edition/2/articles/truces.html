<h1>The Truces</h1><p>Both British and Irish accounts note several truces during the day of fighting. Nurses and doctors from nearby Sir Patrick Dun’s Hospital regularly came to clear the dead and remove the wounded for treatment.&nbsp;</p><p>One of these truces seemed to have occurred around the time of the fiercest faithing in the early evening for Clanwilliam House. The Walsh brothers testimony describes what they saw: ‘There was now some commotion in Lower Mount Street and quite a crowd of onlookers rushed on to the Bridge, led by a clergyman, and cleared it of both dead and dying. They were carried to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital by dying. They were carried to Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital by way of the Nurses' Home. I should mention here the bravery of two girls, who ran up under fire and carried away the wounded. I learned afterwards that their names were Loo Nolan and Kathleen Pierce, and I heard they were presented with medals for valour by the English King.’&nbsp;</p><p>(BMH WS0198, p18)</p>
