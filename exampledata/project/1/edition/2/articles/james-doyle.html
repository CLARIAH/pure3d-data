Born in Wicklow in 1898, and second eldest of five children, Doyle moved to Dublin in 1914 and was working as a shop assistant. There, in October 1914, he joined the Irish Volunteers and was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood about a month before the Easter Rising (NAI, 1911 census; MAI, BMH WS 127, WS 309; MAI, MSPR 34/REF/20659). Doyle was one of the men who, under Section Commander George Reynolds, occupied Clanwilliam House on Easter Monday 1916. Doyle took part in the defence of Clanwilliam House and remained there until its fall at the end of the battle on Wednesday, when he escaped. Towards the end of the fighting Doyle’s rifle exploded and rendered him temporarily unconscious. Though badly hurt during his escape, he managed to avoid detection and arrest, eventually leaving the city before returning in December 1916 (MAI, BMH WS 127, WS 309). Doyle was attached to the active service unit of the 3rd battalion, Dublin Brigade during the War of Independence and took part in a number of operations, including the killings on Bloody Sunday 1920. He was arrested after a large-scale attack on the Custom House in May 1921 and imprisoned until December but did not take part in the Civil War. (MAI, MSPR 34/REF/20659). After the Rising, Doyle worked as a shop assistant in Redmond’s Hill, in the shop run by sisters of George Reynolds (killed in Clanwilliam House). By the late 1920s he claimed to suffer from deafness and nerves as a result of the explosion of his rifle in 1916. Doyle was unmarried and had no children. (MAI, MSPR WDP/1345). James Doyle died in Baltinglass on 21 July 1980 (Irish Press, 22 Jul. 1980).</p>
