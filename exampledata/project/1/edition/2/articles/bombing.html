<h1>The Bombing of Clanwilliam House</h1><p>Eventually C Company of the 2/8th managed to get enough men under the bridge and behind the hoarding. Lieutenant Hewitt was able to secure a bucket of bombs which were thrown into the lower floors which began a fire. According to the Regimental History of the 2.8th ‘The floors of the upper rooms were strewn with shavings and straw and caught fire, by what means is uncertain, and in an incredibly short time the whole house was burning fiercely, and had to be evacuated at 10.30 p.m.’</p><p>(Sherwood Foresters p. 42)</p>
