<h1>What it was Like Inside</h1><p>Irish&nbsp;accounts of this fierce fighting for Clanwilliam House also exist. James Doyle describes what it was like inside: â€˜ Fire was now directed on us from all directions. The wall of the room facing the windows was cut to pieces and the plaster on the ceiling was falling. We could now hear explosions on the ground floor. As [William] Ronan and myself were at the window nearest to the landing door, [George] Reynolds shouted for us to try and get upstairs and fire from the top windows as it might draw some of the fire off the drawing room. Both of us crawled out of the room. The stairs were almost shot to pieces and water was coming as if some pipe had got hit. We succeeded in reaching the top landing.&nbsp;</p><p>(BMH WSO127)</p>
