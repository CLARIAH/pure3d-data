<h1>Battle Preparations</h1><p>At first 25 Northumberland Road was fortified by four men: Michael Malone, the commanding officer, Seamus Grace, Paddy Rowe, and Michael Byrne.&nbsp;</p><p>On Monday afternoon, the Gorgeous Wrecks who were training in the Wicklow Mountains, heard about the Rising and marched back to Beggars Bush Barracks in two columns. The first and smaller column&nbsp;came under fire by the men at 25 Northumberland Road and in which four killed and several wounded. It is largely believed that none of the men were not armed.&nbsp;</p><p>Two of the Volunteers&nbsp;in 25 were under the age of sixteen: Rowe and Bryne.&nbsp;In the days leading up to the battle, the group would receive food, water and other supplies from family members sympathetic to the cause.</p><p>In an ominous sign of what was to come, on Wednesday morning Malone sent the two young Volunteers home for their own safety, telling them to deliver letters to family members. The young volunteers protested, but yielded to Malone’s rank and authority, evacuating the building. Malone is said to have then declared ‘We know what we are dying for, thank God the day has come.’ (Catholic Bulletin, 1916).</p><p>More Information can be found at: <a href="https://www.dublincity.ie/library/blog/grs" target="_blank">Dublin City Library</a></p>
