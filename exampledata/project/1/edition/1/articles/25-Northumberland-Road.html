</table></p><p>25 Northumberland Road, a three-storey, Victorian terraced townhouse on the corner of the junction with Haddington Road, was the most southerly building occupied by C Company. The building was the home of Michael Cussen, described by Grace as ‘friendly’, who had evacuated his family and servants in advance of the Rising (DCLA, Dublin City Electoral Rolls, 1914; Thom’s Directory, 1916; MAI, BMH WS 310).</p><p>C Company had no way of knowing which routes the British would take into the city centre, but if the British decided that one of their routes would be along the Coast Road, 25 Northumberland Road would be the first point where they met Irish Resistance.</p><p>(MAI, BMH WS 310, 1949, p. 6)</p>
