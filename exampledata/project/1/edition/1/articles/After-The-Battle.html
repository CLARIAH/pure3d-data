</table><p>The 2/7th and 2/8th battalions continued to fight at Mount Street Bridge after the fall of 25 Northumberland Road. Over the course of the day, the British seized further buildings until they reached Clanwilliam House which was the last Irish-occupied building to fall at Mount Street Bridge.&nbsp;</p><p>Once the battle had concluded, the 2/7th and 2/8th received new orders on the morning of April 27th. Instead of going to Trinity College as had been their initial objective, they were ordered to go to the Royal Hospital Kilmainham. However, on their way to the hospital, the 2/7th and 2/8th encountered further dangers. At the South Dublin Union, the British soldiers were confronted with ‘considerable resistance’ and ‘much sniping’ which is noted in the regimental history of the 2/7th battalion. However, the casualties for the 2/7th in this confrontation remained low as ‘most of the fighting on this day [fell] to the 2/8th Battalion’. Ultimately, both battalions reached the hospital where the soldiers were quartered.</p><p>(Hughes et al., 2017; 1/7th, 2/7th, 3/7th Sherwood Foresters)</p>
