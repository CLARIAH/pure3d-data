description: |-
  A three-storey, Victorian terraced town-house on the corner of the junction
  with Haddington Road, 25 Northumberland Road is on the south side
  of the Grand Canal and a short distance from Mount Street Bridge.
  
  It was occupied on Easter Monday by Michael Malone, James Grace, Paddy Rowe
  and Michael Byrne and was the southernmost location occupied by
  C Company, 3rd Battalion Dublin Brigade of the Irish Volunteers
  (Carisbrook House to the south was taken by a different unit).
  The building was the home of Michael Cussen, described by Grace as ‘friendly’,
  who had evacuated his family and servants in advance of the Rising
  (DCLA, Dublin City Electoral Rolls, 1914; Thom’s Directory, 1916; MAI, BMH WS 310).
  
  On Easter Monday afternoon, the garrison in No. 25 fired on a column
  of the Volunteer Training Corps
  (nicknamed the ‘Gorgeous Wrecks’ for their older age profile
  and Georgius Rex armbands) returning to Beggar’s Bush barracks
  after a training exercise.
  Part-time reservists and made up of professional men, many over military age,
  the VTC were unarmed or carrying rifles with no ammunition.
  Five members of the column were killed and seven more wounded.
  The following morning, teenagers Rowe and Byrne were sent home for their own safety,
  leaving Malone and Grace as the sole occupants of No. 25 (MAI, BMH WS 310).
  On Wednesday morning two members of Cumann na mBan,
  including one of Grace’s sisters, delivered a dispatch with news
  of the imminent arrival of British troops marching from Kingstown
  (now Dun Laoghaire).
  Positioned in a third-floor bathroom window,
  Malone was the first Volunteer to open fire on the advancing Sherwood Foresters
  with Grace following suit from a window on the second-floor.
  Their positions offered an ideal field of fire in which to engage British troops
  moving up Northumberland Road towards the city and along Haddington Road.

  No. 25 was the first rebel position to fall after it was repeatedly charged
  by 2/7th Sherwood Foresters armed with hand grenades and its door blown in.

  Malone was killed by rifle fire but Grace managed to escape
  (MAI, MSPR 34/REF/368; MAI, BMH WS 310).
